A structured collection of Java implementations for **Low-Level Design (LLD)** and **RESTful API Architecture**. 
Master the art of software architecture with this Java-based guide to Low-Level Design (LLD). This repository bridges the gap between pure OOP theory and production-grade applications. It covers everything from foundational SOLID principles and Design Patterns to modern REST API Design with Spring Boot, focusing on clean layering, DTO patterns, and decoupled business logic. This repository is designed to help developers write clean, maintainable code following industry best practices like SOLID and Design Patterns.

## 🚀 Key Modules

### 🌐 REST API Design (Spring Boot)
How to apply LLD principles to web services:
- **Layered Architecture:** Controller → Service → Repository.
- **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Decoupling internal entities from public API responses.

### 🎨 Design Patterns
Practical implementations of GOF patterns:
- **Creational:** Singleton, Factory, Builder.
- **Structural:** Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Proxy.
- **Behavioral:** Strategy, Observer, State, Command.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java 11+
- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Web.
- **Concepts:** OOP, Multi-threading, Design Patterns, REST.
